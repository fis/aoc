# AoC 2023 solution notes

## Background

If you've ended up reading this, chances are you already know what this is all
about. If not, see the background sections of the various previous years.

Without further ado...

## [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1): Trebuchet?!

As usual, there isn't much to say about the first day. Decided to scan from both
ends of the string separately. To handle the words, rather than coming up with a
custom string set search routine, just looking them up individually within the
span of string still remaining.

Feeling very rusty at Burlesque, which is also typical.

### Burlesque

Part 1:

```
ln{:><J-]j[~.+ri}ms
```

Part 2:

```
ln{iS{{j~!}j+]"1one2two3three4four5five6six7seven8eight9nine"{><}gBjfi
2./+.}m[:nzJ-]j[~_+10ug}ms
```

This is based on finding all the suffix strings of the line (`iS`), and for each
of them testing whether any of the digits (numeric or written) is a prefix.
Alternating the numbers and words allows using `{><}gB` to expand them into a
block, giving a semi-compact encoding.

## [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2): Cube Conundrum

Most of the job is in parsing the input; actual tasks are much simpler.

### Burlesque

Part 1:

```
ln{": ";;p^:><rij" ";;2co{-]**3.%jri_+}^m><{-]}gB{)[~>]}m[2rz12?+{<=}Z]r&.*}ms
```

Part 2:

```
ln{": ";;[~" ";;2co{-]**3.%jri_+}^m><{-]}gB{)[~>]}m[pd}ms
```

Combined:

```
1:          p^:><rij                                         2rz12?+{<=}Z]r&.*
C: ln{": ";;        " ";;2co{-]**3.%jri_+}^m><{-]}gB{)[~>]}m[                 }ms
2:          [~                                               pd
```

## [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3): Gear Ratios

Nothing much to say about the Go solution, except that it prompted me to add a
feature to the `util.Level` type so that it keeps a fixed-side region densely
allocated. This makes it perform a lot better for tasks where the area of
interest is predictable and densely packed, without having to give up the
conveniences (`LevelSolver`, nicer API).

For a lot of past problems, had to switch to more rudimentary types like naked
`[][]byte`s and such to get acceptable performance. Benchmarking some of the old
days that still used a `Level`, some of them got pretty nice (up to ~1 order of
magnitude) speedups, and nothing really got slower.

For the Z80 solution, went with a scheme where cell `(x, y)` of the input is
loaded into RAM at address `0x2000 | y<<8 | x`. For the 140-line puzzle input,
this consumes over half the device RAM, but makes it really easy to do the 2D
accessing needed for the task, by just manipulating the high/low halves of the
register pairs.

The Burlesque solutions were added later, and were sufficiently tedious to avoid
spending any time optimizing for them.

### Burlesque

The general idea is this:

- Turn the `abc123def` strings into `{'a 'b 'c 123 123 123 'd 'e 'f}` blocks. In
  other words, each number appears as a whole number for all the locations that
  its digits can be found in.
- Find the 2D `{row col}` indices for all symbols of interest; anything that's
  not a number or a `.` for part 1, or just the `*` symbols for part 2.
- For each index, expand it to its 3x3 neighborhood.
- Replace the index values with the corresponding contents of the schematic.
- Add a separator character between each row, and then remove consecutive
  duplicate elements. This gets rid of the repetition when the same number
  occupies more than one cell adjacent to a symbol.
- Filter away all the non-number contents of the groups.
- For part 2, also filter away all groups that don't have exactly 2 numbers.
- Compute the final values: overall sum for part 1, sum of products for part 2.

Part 1:

```
ln{XX{><j><&&}gb{J-]><{\[sa.*)ri}if}\m}m[JPp{{Jto-]'C==j'.!=&&}fI}m[zi

```

Combined:

C: {{j_+}j+]m[}m^\[{J?dj?i{r@}Z]^pcp{pPjd!}m[3co'xIC=[)-]{to-]'I==}f[
2:                                                                   }m[{L[2==}f[)pd++
```

## [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4): Scratchcards

The Go solution this time has two versions of the code for parsing the cards: a
"simple" one written first that just relies on `strings.Split` and
`strconv.ParseInt`, and a "fast" one that assumes ASCII, at most two-digit
numbers, and so on.

The motivation for adding the second one came from running the Go CPU profiler
on the day benchmark. You can see the absolutely ludicrous results in the file
[2023-day04-prof.png](2023-day04-prof.png). According to synthetic benchmarks
for just the parser part, the other one is roughly 10x faster.

The set intersection builtin `IN` is the MVP of the Burlesque solution. Parsing
is again a large chunk of the total work. The part 2 solution does a reduce step
where the accumulator contains the remaining card counts, and totals are added
to the state stack as each card is processed.

The Z80 solution again uses an addressing trick, where each winning number `x`
is marked by setting the byte at `0x8000 | x`, so that set membership testing
is trivial. This time that takes only about 160 bytes, though. The code also
reads the numbers as hex, since the exact values don't really matter.

## [Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/5): If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer

It's a bit of a stretch, but I'm counting today as this year's first instance of
the traditional AoC pattern, where the solution for part 1 could in theory be
used to solve part 2, but doing so naÃ¯vely would be computationally infeasible.

The natural solution here is to treat the input as a set of intervals, and
transform them as such (splitting where necessary), as opposed to trying to
iterate over each possible range.

As a gratuitous use of *TikZ*, here's a diagram illustrating the part 2 example:

![A diagram illustrating the part 2 example.](math/2023-notes-day05.png)

Doing part 1 in Burlesque was okay enough, but part 2 was a pain. Again, not
feeling like golfing these solutions: it's enough to have them here.

### Burlesque

The two parts don't have all that much in common, so omitting the combined
section. The logic for part 2 this time is:

- Convert the `{dst src len}` ranges into `{start end offset}` ones.
- For each "layer" of mappings, add in synthetic ranges (with `0` offset) to
  make sure that the ranges cover the entire input domain, with no gaps between
  them.
- To solve the problem, do a reduce operation where the current set of input
  ranges meets each set of mappings in turn. The operation:
  - Takes the cross product of input `{is ie}` ranges and `{ms me mo}` mappings.
  - Turns each pair into `{max(is,ms) min(ie,me) mo}` pseudorange.
  - Filters to keep only the `max(...) < min(...)` cases. Together with the
    previous step, this effectively finds all the non-empty intersections the
    input ranges have with the mappings.
  - Add the offset to all the surviving pseudoranges to make them the mapped
    inputs of the next layer.

Part 1:

```

{jJJ_+1[+x/j[+jJ{Jx/[-iT[-)++rm==}j+]x/jfe~]^p.-.+}r[}m[<]
```

Part 2:

```

```

## [Day 6](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/6): Wait For It

Let's start with some notation for a single race. Call the time limit of the
race $T$, and the time you hold down the button $h$. Now we can compute the
distance $d(h)$ you will travel based on the hold time:

$$ d(h) = (T - h) \cdot h $$

Let's also use $d_{\mathrm{best}}$ to denote the previous best distance of the
race. The brute force solution to determine $w$, the number of different ways to
win, is to simply try all the possible choices and count how many of them win:

$$ w = \sum_{h=0}^T [ d(h) > d_{\mathrm{best}} ]
     = \sum_{h=0}^T [ (T - h) \cdot h > d_{\mathrm{best}} ] $$

Normally, when there's a problem where part 1 has a simple brute force solution
like this, running it on part 2 tends to take a long time indeed. But in this
instance, the the runtime is measured in milliseconds even for part 2. So we
could even stop here.

That's not to say we can't do any better, though. Let's take a closer look at
that inequality. We can turn it into a quadratic form:

$$\begin{aligned}
(T - h) \cdot h &> d_{\mathrm{best}} \\
-h^2 + T h - d_{\mathrm{best}} &> 0
\end{aligned}$$

Since it's sad to even entertain the possibility we could not win a race, we can
probably just assume the parameters are always such that the equation has real
solutions. If so, counting the possible ways to win is equivalent to counting
how many integers are in the open interval between the two solutions
$h_{\mathrm{min}}$ and $h_{\mathrm{max}}$. The values of these pop out of the
quadratic formula:

$$\begin{aligned}
h_{\mathrm{min}} &= \frac{1}{2} \left( T - \sqrt{T^2 - 4 d_{\mathrm{best}}} \right) \\
h_{\mathrm{max}} &= \frac{1}{2} \left( T + \sqrt{T^2 - 4 d_{\mathrm{best}}} \right)
\end{aligned}$$

Since we need to beat instead of merely matching the earlier record (that's why
it's an open interval), we'll need to not include $h_{\mathrm{min}}$ or
$h_{\mathrm{max}}$ themselves, should they happen to be integer values.
Therefore the equation for $w$ becomes:

$$\begin{aligned}
w &= \left(\lceil h_{\mathrm{max}} \rceil - 1\right) - \left(\lfloor h_{\mathrm{min}} \rfloor + 1\right) + 1 \\
&= \lceil h_{\mathrm{max}} \rceil - \lfloor h_{\mathrm{min}} \rfloor - 1
\end{aligned}$$

### Burlesque

For Burlesque, there's two solutions to part 2 this time. The first uses the
same brute force approach as part 1, where we calculate the distance for every
possible hold time and then count how many beat the record. This is actually
(barely) computationally feasible even for the full puzzle input, but takes
about 8 gigabytes of RAM and 4 minutes to complete. The second uses the
closed-form solution, but is significantly longer (in terms of code size).

Part 1:

```
ln{WD[-)ri}m[tp{rzJ<-{.*}Z]j?-{0.>}fl}m^pd
```

Part 2 (brute force):

```
ln{:><ri}MPjrzJ<-{.*}Z]j?-{0.>}fl
```

Combined:

```
1:    WD[-)ri m[tp{                     }m^pd
C: ln{       }     rzJ<-{.*}Z]j?-{0.>}fl
2:    :><ri   MPj
```

Part 2 (faster alternative):

```
ln{:><rd}MPjJJ.*x/4.*.-r@2rz?d:nz?*?+2?/^pclj?iav.-ti
```

## [Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7): Camel Cards

For day 7, most of the work was in identifying the different Camel Cards hand
types.

A relatively clean way of doing this is to first count how many times each rank
appears in the hand, and then further count how many times each *count* (which
must necessarily be between 0 and 5, and we can ignore the zeros) appears in the
result.

If we look at the possible hand types, we can see that each is represented by a
unique "signature" of such counts:

```
ABCDE [5 0 0 0 0] - high card
ABCDD [3 1 0 0 0] - one pair
ABBCC [1 2 0 0 0] - two pair
ABCCC [2 0 1 0 0] - three of a kind
AABBB [0 1 1 0 0] - full house
ABBBB [1 0 0 1 0] - four of a kind
AAAAA [0 0 0 0 1] - five of a kind
```

In the above, the letters in `ABCDE` indicate five arbitrary cards, and reuse of
a letter implies that the same card appears again. The list of numbers that
follows is the frequency of each count, where, e.g., `[2 0 1 0 0]` indicates
that there were two ranks that appeared once only in the hand, and one that
appeared three times.

The Go solution uses an explicit `switch` statement to turn the counts into
simple labels. The Burlesque solution, on the other hand, takes advantage of a
second property. If we reverse the list of counts, we can see that the
lexicographical ordering matches the strength of the type, and can therefore be
used to sort the hands.

For part 2, the situation is more complex. Adding an extra value `J` to count
the number of jokers, we can again look at full list of different cases, of
which there are now more:

```
ABCDE [5 0 0 0 0] J=0 - high card
ABCDD [3 1 0 0 0] J=0 - one pair
ABCDJ [4 0 0 0 0] J=1 - one pair
ABBCC [1 2 0 0 0] J=0 - two pair
ABCCC [2 0 1 0 0] J=0 - three of a kind
ABCCJ [2 1 0 0 0] J=1 - three of a kind
ABCJJ [3 0 0 0 0] J=2 - three of a kind
AABBB [0 1 1 0 0] J=0 - full house
AABBJ [0 2 0 0 0] J=1 - full house
ABBBB [1 0 0 1 0] J=0 - four of a kind
AAABJ [1 0 1 0 0] J=1 - four of a kind
ABBJJ [1 1 0 0 0] J=2 - four of a kind
ABJJJ [2 0 0 0 0] J=3 - four of a kind
AAAAA [0 0 0 0 1] J=0 - five of a kind
AAAAJ [0 0 0 1 0] J=1 - five of a kind
AAAJJ [0 0 1 0 0] J=2 - five of a kind
AAJJJ [0 1 0 0 0] J=3 - five of a kind
AJJJJ [1 0 0 0 0] J=4 - five of a kind
JJJJJ [0 0 0 0 0] J=5 - five of a kind
```

For the Go code, there's again an explicit switch that tests the counts (and
`J` value) to figure out the specific case.

For Burlesque, the direct lexicographical ordering no longer works. However, we
can observe from the above table that whenever a joker appears, the value it
will take to maximize the hand strength is that of the rank that appears most
often within the non-joker cards, picking arbitrarily in case of ties (or using
an arbitrary rank in the case of five jokers). Fortuitously, Burlesque has a
built-in for finding the most common element of a list.

### Burlesque

Outline:

- Convert card labels to ranks using the correct numbering.
- For each hand:
  - For part 2 only: replace jokers with the most common non-joker card.
  - Group the cards by rank, and get the group sizes.
  - Count how many each there are of the different possible group sizes.
  - Reverse the list, and append the original hand to it. This forms the sort
    key.
  - Append the bid amount at the end. This doesn't affect the ordering since
    it's at the very end.
- Sort the list, and calculate total wins by summing the product of bids and the
  corresponding ranks.

Part 1:

```

```

## [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8): Haunted Wasteland

For part 1, brute force is the natural choice: just follow the directions step
by step until you end at the end.

While it's possible in theory to do part 2 similarly (just keep track of all the
ghosts and advance each according to the instructions), this time it is actually
too expensive: my puzzle solution is approximately $10^{13}$.

For this acceptably fast solution, the key idea is this: for each ghost
independently, find a cycle that has it repeating the same sequence of nodes. A
cycle is easy to identify: if we ever arrive at the same node while at the same
point in the list of directions, then that's a cycle.

> If there is some particular structure to the graph and the list of directions,
> shorter cycles may also be possible. But there seems to be no need to look for
> some.

In theory, many nodes visited during a cycle might be suitable end positions
(have names ending in `Z`). For this puzzle input, however, it just so happens
that there is always only one. This simplifies the treatment somewhat.

> It also looks like the end node is always right at the end of the cycle, but
> the solution does not assume that to be the case.

Let's assume we've found $N$ cycles. There may be some initial steps before each
cycle begins: let's call that number $s_i$, for cycle $i$. Just to be sure,
we'll want to take care to avoid any solutions that are less than $\max_i s_i$.

For each cycle $i$, there are two parameters: the length of the cycle in steps
($M_i$), and the specific step at which the ghost is in its designated end node
($k_i$). This means that any time $T$ in which *all* the ghosts are at the end
nodes must satisfy $T \equiv k_i \pmod{M_i}$ (and $T \geq s_i$) for all the
cycles.

Consider a pair of cycles that, without loss of generality, are numbered $1$ and
$2$ with $M_1 > M_2$. To find a solution that satisfies both, we can check the
numbers that are of the form $k_1 + n \cdot M_1$ for some integer $n$. Once we
find a suitable number $a$ of that form where
$a \equiv k_2 \pmod{M_2},\ a \geq s_1,\ a \geq s_2$, we can replace that
pair of cycles with a single cycle $C$, representing both, with the parameters
$k_C = a$ and $M_C = \mathrm{LCM}(M_1, M_2)$. In this way, we can reduce the
size of our set of cycles by one. Finally, we can iterate the process until only
a single cycle remains, at which point the answer to the puzzle can be derived
from the $k$ value of the sole remaining cycle.

For my puzzle input, there were six `??A` (and `??Z`) nodes, and therefore also
six cycles. The cycle lengths were 12169, 13301, 14999, 17263, 20093 and 22357.
While multiplying all six together would produce an 84-bit integer, we can note
that they all share a factor in common:

| cycle length | factorization |
|--------------|---------------|
| 12169        | 43 Â· 283      |
| 13301        | 47 Â· 283      |
| 14999        | 53 Â· 283      |
| 17263        | 61 Â· 283      |
| 20093        | 71 Â· 283      |
| 22357        | 79 Â· 283      |

Consequently, the least common multiple of the entire set is merely a 44-bit
integer.

> Update 2023-12-09: As a performance optimization, the Go code is now checking
> for cycles only at the start of each run through the entire list of
> directions. This allows it to no longer track both the node and the position
> in the direction list when checking for cycles.

### Burlesque

Part 1 is *reasonably* simple and fast. It treats the node names as base-26
numbers (with `A` = 0 and so on), and uses a 20k-element list ($>26^3$) to store
the directions. Then it just makes an infinite cycle out of the directions, and
uses a `w!` loop to iterate until arriving on the `ZZZ` node.

Part 2 is anything but. It uses the same algorithm as the Go solution, but for
finding the cycles it just uses a flat list as the `seen` map, so runtime is at
best quadratic to cycle length. It takes approximately a minute to run for the
puzzle input.

In retrospect, it might have been better for part 1 to not bother making the
"fast" map. It likely isn't all that fast.

## [Day 9](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/9): Mirage Maintenance

Today might have been the first instance where I wrote the Burlesque solution
first. It's kind of well-suited to it.

This time there's no twist, and simply implementing the problem statement is a
perfectly adequate solution. The Burlesque version builds the triangle of
differences out explicitly, and then extracts the last element and does the
necessary operations to get the prediction. Go version does it in-place (though
on a copy of the list since it's still needed for later).

The problem as described is a case of
[polynomial interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation)
with consecutive equally spaced data points, and the problem statement is pretty
much describing the forward/backward difference expressions of a
[Newton polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_polynomial). Not sure
if this would yield some shortcuts in calculating the prediction; the task does
not really need any.

### Burlesque

Part 1:

```

```

Part 2:

```

```

Combined:

```
C: lnps   {sa-.{J2CO{.-}m^}jE!CL)[~++}ms
2:     )<-
```

## [Day 10](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/10): Pipe Maze

Looking at the examples and the puzzle input, it seems to be the case that out
of the neighbour tiles of the starting position, only the two that are part of
the loop are such that they could connect to it. This being the case, tracing
the loop is a matter of finding a neighbour that connects, and then following
the tracks until they lead back to the beginning.

Where it gets slightly trickier is in finding the area, as that requires
figuring out what's inside and what's outside. In this solution, that is based
on
[this rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_orientation#Orientation_of_a_simple_polygon)
of figuring out the orientation of a simple polygon. After that, the code just
does a DFS flood-fill for each tile that's on the inside side next to the loop
boundary.

## [Day 11](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/11): Cosmic Expansion

Today's twist was only twisty if your part 1 solution involved explicitly
constructing the expanded map. In my case, the Go solution instead iterates over
the original galaxy positions and updates the locations as it goes along.

An alternative solution could be to compute the distances in the original map,
but count empty rows/columns as worth more. The Burlesque solution goes this
route.

### Burlesque

This is based on finding, for each pair of galaxies, the range (`r@`) of row and
column indices between them, and then intersecting the ranges with the lists of
empty rows and columns, respectively.

Part 1:

```

Part 2:

```

Combined:

```

C: {tpg0{j><^pr@[-sa#rINL[       }Z]++}ms
2:                        1e6-..*
```

## [Day 12](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/12): Hot Springs

The solution here is a
[dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming#Computer_science)
kind of a thing.

Let's denote by `a[i,j]`, where `0 â¤ i â¤ n`, `0 â¤ j â¤ m`, the number of ways it
is possible to arrange `groups[i:]` (i.e., all groups from the `i`th group
onwards) into `row[j:]` (i.e., the suffix of the row from the `j`th spring
onwards). In this case, `a[0,0]` is the answer to the puzzle: the number of ways
to arrange all the groups into the entire row.

We have the following relationships within the elements of the table:

```
a[n,j] = 0, if row[j:] contains any '#' characters
         1, if row[j:] contains only '.' or '?' characters

a[i,m] = 0, if i < n; 1 otherwise

a[i,j] = sum of:
           a[i,j+1] if row[j] is not '#'
           a[i+1][j+g+1] if current group (of size g) can fit at position j
```

This represents the following logical conditions:

- If there are no groups left, they can be arranged in one way if the target
  consists of only `.` or `?` (by having all springs fully functional), or they
  can't be arranged at all if there are some `#` characters (as those would have
  to be part of a group).
- If there is no row remaining, there's either one way (if all groups have been
  placed) or no ways (if some groups still remain).
- If there are some groups left, there are two possibilities:
  - We can start the group at some later position, which is only possible if the
    first character of the target range is not `#`; in that case, we need to
    arrange the remaining groups in the remainder of the row.
  - Or we can put the first group here (assuming it fits, i.e., there are no `.`
    characters within the group, and no `#` immediately after), and arrange the
    remaining groups in the leftover space.

The initial Go solution built the full table from the bottom up. Current
solution instead does it top-down with recursion, which seems to be a little
(~30%) faster, presumably because not all the elements are actually used for the
final answer.

## [Day 13](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/13): Point of Incidence

The Go solution parses the input directly into both a row-major and a
column-major bitmap, where each row (or column, respectively) is an `uint32`.
This makes it quite quick to compare entire rows (or columns) with a single `==`
operation for part 1, or compute the number of differences by doing a `xor`
operation and then counting number of set bits for part 2.

### Burlesque

The high-level structure involves constructing a transposed version of the
pattern (with `)XXtp)\[`), mapping a piece of code that locates the line of
reflection over both the original and the transposed versions, and then treating
the result as the digits of a base-100 number (`100ug`) to combine them as
required by the puzzle.

Part 1:

```
ln""bx;;{J)XXtp)\[bxj+]{sarojbc{zij{-].<}[[ptp^<-
z[{)[~p^==}al}Z]1Fi+.}m[100ug}ms
```

Part 2:

```
ln""bx;;{J)XXtp)\[bxj+]{sarojbc{zij{-].<}[[ptp^<-
{)[~p^{!=}Z]++}Z[++}Z]1Fi+.}m[100ug}ms
```

Combined:

```
C: ln""bx;;{J)XXtp)\[bxj+]{sarojbc{zij{-].<}[[ptp^<-

1: z[      ==}al
C:   {)[~p^             }Z]1Fi+.}m[100ug}ms
2:         {!=}Z]++}Z[++
```

## [Day 14](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/14): Parabolic Reflector Dish

Not much of a trick today. It doesn't take many iterations of the spin sequence
to find a cycle (for me, there's a cycle of length 18 that begins after 122
spins), but it still takes a non-trivial amount of time to do all that sliding.

### Burlesque

Golfed the part 1 solution to a moderately pleasant size, but for part 2 just
didn't bother. It's based on just keeping the full list of seen platform
contents on the stack, and iterating until something that's already on the list
shows up. The spin cycle is implemented by evaluating a "turn 90Â° and slide"
core 4 times.

Part 1:

```
ln)XXtp{{'#==}gB)<>\[<-{'O==}fI?i++}ms
```

Part 2:

```
ln)XX)<-<-{tp{<-{'#==}gB)<>\[}m[}s0{}j{Jx/j+]jg04E!}{~[n!}w!

```

## [Day 15](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/15): Lens Library

Hmm, well. Feels like today was just a matter of implementing a specification,
rather than figuring out a puzzle.

### Burlesque

Part 1 is pleasantly short, as befits a task like this. Part 2 is not. Having a
lot of "branching" logic isn't Burlesque's strong suit, and couldn't figure out
a clever way to do the "remove, update or add" logic other than explicitly
spelling out the cases. Even the nested multiplications in the scoring are
inelegant.

Part 1:

```
t]",";;{XX0+]{**.+17.*256.%}r[}ms
```

Part 2:

```
t]",";;{}256.*+]{J:rdXX0+]{**.+17.*256.%}r[j{J[~'-=={~]'=[+{~!n!}j+]f[}j{s0J{~!}

```

## [Day 16](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/16): The Floor Will Be Lava

If there's a trick to today's part 2, I have not found it yet. Just re-running
the part 1 solution for all the possible inputs.

There's probably a lot of duplicate work (as the paths are bound to merge
together), but it seems hard to reuse old solutions as the final result must
avoid double-counting cells crossed by multiple beams.

## [Day 17](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/17): Clumsy Crucible

I'm just using
[Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm),
with the pre-existing [bucket queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_queue)
as the priority queue; also known as
[Dial's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#Specialized_variants).
The edge weights (the heat loss values) are between 1-9, so 16 buckets is
sufficient.

The search runs on a graph where (conceptually) the vertices are states composed
of the current city block, movement direction, and number of consecutive steps
so far. There's also one extra pruning rule for part 1: smaller numbers of
consecutive steps are strictly better (in the sense that it restricts future
choices less), so a vertex need not be explored if the same city block has been
already visited with the same number *or fewer* steps. This does not hold in
part 2 due to the minimum step requirement, so that part just uses a bitmap.

## [Day 18](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/18): Lavaduct Lagoon

In my opinion (and in this solution), most of the work went to extracting the
exact outer bound of the area of interest.

We can easily trace the loop by following the digging instructions, but this
gives coordinates of the 1 meter cubes that have been dug out. To calculate the
area, it would be more useful to find the outer bounary of those cubes, and that
depends on knowing which side is the inside, which may not always be obvious.

For the solution here, we do it by first locating the top-left corner: the point
with the lowest X coordinate out of all the points with the lowest Y coordinate.
Due to the nature of the digging, there are only two possibilities: it must be
either an up-then-right or a left-then-down corner. We can use that to choose
the direction in which we iterate the points, so that the inside is always a
predictable side, say right, of the edge.

To adjust the coordinates of the corner points to extract the outer edge, we can
take a look at the 8 possible corners there are. Denoting the (normalized)
direction of the digging by the `v` `>` `^` `<` characters, the current corner
by `*`, the inside of the area by `#` and the outside by `.`, we have:

```
.....  ..^##  ##v..  ##v..  ..^##  #####  .....  #####
.....  ..^##  ##v..  ##v..  ..^##  #####  .....  #####
>>*..  >>*##  <<*..  ##*>>  ..*<<  ##*<<  ..*>>  <<*##
##v..  #####  .....  #####  .....  ##v..  ..^##  ..^##
##v..  #####  .....  #####  .....  ##v..  ..^##  ..^##

 (1)    (2)    (3)    (4)    (5)    (6)    (7)    (8)
```

The initial coordinates are effectively of the top-left corner of the `*`. We
can see that we get the coordinates of the actual outer edge by selectively
adding 1 to the X and/or the Y coordinate. The cases where we do need to
increment the coordinates are:

|   | (1) | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) | (6) | (7) | (8) |
|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| X |  +1 |     |  +1 |  +1 |     |  +1 |     |     |
| Y |     |     |  +1 |     |  +1 | +1  |     |  +1 |

In other words, we'll need to add 1 to the X coordinate if we're either exiting
or entering the corner moving down (cases 1, 3, 4, 6), and correspondingly to
the Y coordinate if we're exiting or entering moving left (cases 3, 5, 6, 8).

Once we have the coordinates of a polygon denoting the dig, computing its area
is basically a known problem.

The solution here is derived from the
[trapezoid formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula#Trapezoid_formula)
(for a positively oriented polygon), except that since our polygon always
consists of a sequence of alternating horizontal and vertical edges (with a
horizontal edge coming first), for an even $i$ the $x_{i+1} - x_i$ term is
always zero, and for an odd $i$ the $y_{i+1} + y_i$ term is just $2 y_i$. So the
formula simplifies to:

$$\begin{aligned}
A &= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(y_{i+1} + y_i\right) \left( x_{i+1} - x_i \right) \\
  &= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{\frac{n}{2}} 2 y_{2k} \left( x_{2k} - x_{2k-1} \right) \\
  &= \sum_{k=1}^{\frac{n}{2}} y_{2k} \left( x_{2k} - x_{2k-1} \right)
\end{aligned}$$

The geometric interpretation for this is that instead of summing trapezoids,
we're summing a sequence of oriented rectangles, ignoring the degenerate cases
of vertical edges.

Note to self: this might be worth a TikZ diagram.

### Burlesque

This implements pretty much the same algorithm as the Go code, with no notable
golfing. The only difference between the parts is in parsing. Oh, and it does
the full trapezoid formula to avoid having to normalize the starting point.

## [Day 19](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/19): Aplenty

No trick needed. Part 1 evaluates the workflows as specified; part 2 recurses
over the workflows using intervals to indicate the space of acceptable parts.

Just for fun, we can render the example workflows as a graph:

![A graph showing the workflow rules.](2023-day19-ex.png)

(The full ruleset is slightly too large for the same treatment, but is still a
tree.)

We could also try visualizing the way the ruleset subdivides the space of valid
parts into accepted and rejected regions, but that would be easier in four
dimensions.

### Burlesque

Clever trick in part 1: to evaluate something like `>1234`, prepend a `.` and
parse the result as a Burlesque expression; the result is `{.> 1234}`, which can
then be reversed and evaluated with `e!` to perform the desired function.

Had to fall back to developing part 2 with functions (and then inlining the
non-recursive ones). It is pretty long. But didn't take that long to implement.

Part 1:

```

## [Day 20](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/20): Pulse Propagation

Solving part 2 in the general case feels quite tricky (wouldn't know where to
begin, except for the brute-force method of simulating it), so let's take a look
at the input graph to see if it has any structure to make use of.

An acceptable GraphViz rendering of the graph can be found in
[2023-day20-input.png](2023-day20-input.png). "BC" denotes the special broadcast
node, and "rx" is the output that we want a low pulse in; flip-flops modules
(and outputs) are blue while conjunctions are red. It's immediately clear that
the graph has four more or less independent sections. Looking at them more
closely, all four sections have the following properties:

- The initial broadcast goes to one and only one flip-flop module in the
  section.
- That flip-flop is the head of a linear chain of 12 flip-flops.
- In addition to the flip-flops, each section has its own dedicated conjunction
  module, which some subset of the flip-flop modules connect to.
- That conjunction module outputs to the head flip-flop, as well as all
  flip-flops that do *not* connect to the conjunction.
- In addition, each section's conjunction connects to a single-input conjunction
  (an inverter), which connects to a single conjunction that's global to the
  entire graph, which is the only thing that connects to the special `rx` output
  node.

In order to receive a low pulse at `rx`, we must receive a high pulse at the
penultimate conjunction module from each of the four sections. Due to the
inverters, this will only happen if the per-section conjunction modules all have
most recently sent a low pulse. What might it take for that to happen?

Let's first consider the behavior of a chain of flip-flops and ignore the other
connections. Assuming the flip-flops are in their initial state (off), this will
cause the head flip-flop to flip on, and send a high pulse to the next
flip-flop. Since that pulse is high, it will be ignored. However, the *next* low
pulse to the head will cause it to flop off, and send a low pulse instead. By
induction, we can see that a chain of N flip-flops forms an N-bit binary
counter.

Next, let's consider the role of the per-section conjunction modules. As long as
at least one of the connected flip-flops (bits) remains (0), the conjunction's
outgoing pulse will be high, and therefore the feedback going back to the
flip-flops will be ignored, so the counter behavior is unaffected.

The first time something else happens is when the counter reaches the value
where all the input flip-flops are on at the same time. At the time, the
remaining flip-flops will be off (otherwise it wouldn't be the first occasion).
At this point, the conjunction module will send a low pulse to turn each
remaining flip-flop on as well, and then "add one": this resets the entire
flip-flop chain to all-off (zero). So the counters will count up to this value
and then reset.

In order for the graph-wide conjunction module to get simultaneous low pulses
from every graph subsection, we must press the button enough times that all four
counters hit zero at the same time. In other words, we need to find the least
common multiple of all the counter target values. (Or for my input, their
product, as they all seem to be prime numbers.)

## [Day 21](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/21): Step Counter

For part 1, we can do a simple BFS in the level to discover the reachable tiles.
A tile is reachable in $n$ steps if the Manhattan distance to it is no more than
$n$, and has the same "parity" (is even or odd) as $n$.

Part 2 looks a lot more tricky at first. But wait, let's take a look at what the
solution from part 1 looked like:

![A graphical representation of the input map.](2023-day21-map.png)

In the above, rocks are represented by red, garden plots by green, and the blue
region marks the garden plots whose distance from the start point is at most 64
(ignoring the parity aspect). There's a conspicuous circular (in terms of the
Manhattan distance) "green belt" area devoid of any rocks, that seems designed
(intelligent design!) to allow the various possible paths to "line up", leaving
the equidistant boundary a perfect circle.

Since this blank area also repeats infinitely, it could be that there's also a
pattern to the number of tiles reachable in $n$ steps, as $n$ grows by multiples
of the map size $D$. In my case, $D = 131$.

Let's use $S$ to denote the ultimately interesting step count of 26501365, and
$T$ the number of tiles reachable in that many steps. If we say $t(n)$ is the
number of tiles reachable in $n D + S \bmod D$ steps, then
$T = t(\lfloor \frac{S}{D} \rfloor) = t(202300)$.

> The 202300 is probably not a coincidence.

To get started, we can write a piece of code that can run the BFS for the
infinitely repeated level, at least for reasonable step counts. Let's do that,
and take a look at the first few values of $t(n)$, as well as their first and
second differences:

| $n$                        | 0    | 1     | 2     | 3      | 4      |
|----------------------------|------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| $t(n)$                     | 3832 | 33967 | 94056 | 184099 | 304096 |
| $t'(n) = t(n) - t(n-1)$    |      | 30135 | 60089 | 90043  | 119997 |
| $t''(n) = t'(n) - t'(n-1)$ |      |       | 29954 | 29954  | 29954  |

Well, *that* looks pretty constant there on the bottom row. Let's just assume
it is actually constant (and denote $t''(n) = t'' = 29954$), and see if we could
use that to extrapolate to $t(202300)$.

We will take $t(0)$, $t(1)$ and $t(2) as constants. From these three, we can
also derive:

$$\begin{aligned}
t'(1) &= t(1) - t(0) \\
t'(2) &= t(2) - t(1) \\
  t'' &= t'(2) - t'(1) \\
      &= t(2) - 2t(1) + t(0)
\end{aligned}$$

For the more general case of $t'(n)$, we get:

$$\begin{aligned}
 t''  &= t'(n) - t'(n-1) \\
t'(n) &= t'(n-1) + t'' \\
t'(n) &= t'(1) + \sum_{i=2}^n t'' = t'(1) + (n-1) t''
\end{aligned}$$

And we can do the same for $t(n)$, given the above:

$$\begin{aligned}
t'(n) &= t(n) - t(n-1) \\
 t(n) &= t(n-1) + t'(1) + (n-1) t'' \\
 t(n) &= t(0) + \sum_{i=1}^n \left( t'(1) + (i-1) t'' \right) \\
      &= t(0) + n t'(1) + \frac{n(n-1)}{2} t''
\end{aligned}$$

If we express this in terms of our initial three values, we end up with:

$$\begin{aligned}
t(n) &= a n^2 + b^n + c \\
   a &= \frac{1}{2} \left(s(2) - 2s(1) + s(0)\right) \\
   b &= s(1) - s(0) - a \\
   c &= s(0)
\end{aligned}$$

At this point, the solution is just a matter of computing $s(0)$, $s(1)$ and
$s(2)$, using them to derive $a$, $b$ and $c$, and then evaluating
$T = t(202300)$.

## [Day 22](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/22): Sand Slabs

The first complete solution I had for today was really simple: after dropping
all the bricks down, it simply re-ran the same code with a single brick removed,
for each of the bricks, and counted how many bricks moved during the repacking.
If none did, then the removed brick counted towards part 1; otherwise, all those
that did counted towards part 2.

This makes for an $O(n^2)$ algorithm as long as the packing is $O(n)$, which is
not hard to accomplish by doing a single pass over the bricks while tracking the
current top $z$ coordinate at each $(x, y)$ position. But the number of bricks
is pretty modest, so the whole thing still ran in a little under 20
milliseconds.

Current solution instead makes the initial packing step construct a DAG where an
edge $v \rightarrow w$ exists if brick $v$ supports brick $w$ (i.e., $w$ rests
directly on top of $v$). This allows a similar $O(n^2)$ algorithm to run on the
graph: for each brick, count (using a DFS) which bricks are still reachable if
that brick was removed. If all of them are, the brick is safe to remove
(counting towards part 1). Otherwise, the unreachable bricks are those that
would fall (counting towards part 2).

## [Day 23](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/23): A Long Walk

Today's
[longest path problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_path_problem) is
well-known to be NP-hard in the general case.

For part 1, the graph that we get by unravelling the maze is directed, due to
the slopes permitting travel in one direction only. It is also highly regular.
Have a look at the GraphViz renderings:

- Puzzle example: [2023-day23-ex.png](2023-day23-ex.png).
- Puzzle input: [2023-day23-input.png](2023-day23-input.png).

Since these are DAGs, we can find a longest path by performing a
[topological sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting), and then
iterating over the vertices in that order and setting the longest path based on
the (already visited) predecessors of the vertex.

In part 2, where the same graph is made undirected, this no longer works. The
graph still has the same structure (it's effectively a finite
[lattice graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_graph)) with two corners
eliminated by path contraction), so a more optimal solution may exist, though it
seems not to be an obvious one. Here, we just fall back to an exhaustive search,
which is just barely acceptably fast (just shy of 0.14 seconds).

We can also take a look at the resulting path:
[2023-day23-input-2.png](2023-day23-input-2.png).

## [Day 24](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/24): Never Tell Me The Odds

Really more of a math challenge than a programming challenge, at least the way I
did it. There's probably more "code-based" ways of doing part 2 as well, though.

The amount of math in this is sufficient to noticeably bog down the rendering,
so it's in a separate file: [2023-day24.md](2023-day24.md).

If you're viewing this on GitHub, you'll be wanting
[2023-day24-github.md](2023-day24-github.md) instead, as the GitHub renderer
does not like certain use of the `_` character in `$`- or `$$`-delimited math
blocks, and requires them either be escaped as `\_`. However, the KaTeX-based
preview in Visual Studio Code (which I'm writing this in) does not like *that*.
It seems impossible to satisfy both.

## [Day 25](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/25): Snowverload

To be honest, I was expecting something a little less of a regular puzzle for
day 25. But unless I'm missing something, this could have been any other day
(except for the lack of part 2).

The [min-cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_cut) problem is of course
well known in graph theory, and there are a number of algorithms available,
mostly for weighted graphs. Here, we do something quite a lot simpler, based on
the fact that we know there is a unique minimum cut of size 3.

We have a graph $G = (V, E)$. Let's assume we know a pair of vertices
$s, t \in V$ that are definitely in the two different partitions $S$ and $T$
corresponding to the minimum cut we want to find. To find the cut, we can use
the following procedure:

- Find the shortest path $p_1$ between $s$ and $t$. Since they're in different
  partitions, at least one of the three cut edges is in the path $p_1$.
- For each edge $e_1 \in p_1$:
  - Remove $e_1 = (u_1, v_1)$ from the graph.
  - Find the shortest path $p_2$ between $u_1$ and $v_1$. If $e_1$ was truly one
    of the minimum cut edges, then $u_1 \in S, v_1 \in T$ (or the other way
    around), and one of the remaining two cut edges must be in $p_2$.
  - For each edge $e_2 \in p_2$:
    - Remove $e_2 = (u_2, v_2)$ from the graph.
    - Again, find a new shortest path $p_3$ between $u_2$ and $v_2$. By the same
      argument, if both $e_1$ and $e_2$ were part of the minimum cut, the sole
      remaining edge must be in $p_3$.
    - For each edge $e_3 \in p_3$:
      - Remove $e_3 = (u_3, v_3)$ from the graph.
      - If $e_3$ was the correct edge, the graph is now cut. Otherwise, it's
        still a single connected component.
      - Find $|S|$, the size of the connected component $u_3$ is in. This search
        can also terminate early if it encounters $v_3$.
      - If the search found $v_3$, the set $(e_1, e_2, e_3)$ was not a cut,
        because the endpoints of $e_3$ are still connected. Continue.
      - Otherwise it was *the* cut. In this case  $|S|$ is one of the partition
        sizes, and $|T| = |V| - |S|$ is the size of the other partition.

Now we just need to pick $s, t$ correctly. A simple choice would be to repeat
the above for all pairs of vertices: if we pick accidentally pick two vertices
in $S$ (or $T$), the algorithm simply terminates without finding a cut.

What's done here is slightly more handwavy. We first pick $s$ arbitrarily. Then
we find some $t$ that achieves a distance $d(s, t) = \epsilon(s)$, where
$\epsilon(s)$ is the eccentricity of $s$. Intuitively, this corresponds to
picking $t$ that's "as far away from $s$ as possible", under the assumption that
it's likely to be in the other component. As a side effect, this step also finds
path $p_1$ in the above algorithm. Then we run the rest of the steps, and if no
cut was found, try again with a different $s$.

It's possible that the above might not work for some graphs. But it works for
the example and the puzzle input, which is by definition good enough.

Finally, here's the puzzle example. To a human, the minimum cut (highlighted in
red) is obvious. It's curious how non-obvious finding it is to a computer.

A median day seems to be somewhere around half a millisecond. Lowlight of the
year of course being day 23 with its exhaustive search for part 2. Oh, well. It
doesn't look that bad in log-scale:
